When I started writing code. There was one question I kept asking myself. What is the point of a style guide. I thought as long as my code worked it doesn't matter what the code looks like. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this thought. As I've coded more and more, I noticed I would lose some of my code. Either because I didn't name it right. Or I have it in a completely random order. I started looking into style guides a little more. And now finally understand the importance to them. 

If a style guide is followed. Then the code that has a company of 100 people working on it. Should look like one person did it. A style guide allows other coders to be able to take a look at your work and understand where everything is. And why everything is there. It limits the amount of questions. And the ability for the other coding jumping in to get lost in your code. 

Let's go back to the thought I had. “As long as my code works it doesn't matter what the code looks like”. If you are a coder. And don’t want to listen to how others are coding. And their style guides. Then simply create your own. If you work alone then creating your own style guide is a solution. Though it does require a bit more work then you might think.

Creating your own style guide isn't as easy as just coding what you need to code. As you go along you need to collect your variable names. And give them a proper description. You will also have to keep track of your folder names, their hierarchy, and your image naming. 

We can take it a step further! Style guides are not just used for coding. If you are a coder then make a style guide for your coding. But if you are working for a company. Then your style guide will look a bit different. Obviously you'll still need to either create a style guide for your coding. Or use one that may already be implemented by who you are working with. But you will also need to add typography, color, logos, images. Everything that will make up what the finished product will be. All of this has to be recorded in a style guide. 

Ok. Let's flip the switch a little bit and dive into another topic. Naming conventions. Like style guides. I also thought “what is the point”, because at the end of the day you can name your variables and code almost anything. But like following style guides, there is a naming convention that all coders should follow.

Let's start off with one question. “What is a naming convention”. Naming convention allows your code to be more readable to others. The goal of a naming convention is to create variable names that describe what their function is. This allows the other coder or even yourself to read it and understand what it does instantly. 

When creating names for your variables it’s important to use words that everyone can understand. You also have to make sure your code names are consistent. And that each one follows the same rules of one another. For example there are a few styles for variable names. “Snakecase” is when you separate each variable work with a “_”. Example: “variable_one”. Another is “Pascalcase” which is when words are separated by capital letters. Example: “VariableOne”. Next is “Camelcase” which is when every word except the initial one has a capital letter. Example: “variableOne”. If you choose one of these naming conventions make sure you use it the whole way through. And be consistent with it.
